        biography: `
        The son of a lighthouse keeper and an Atlantean queen, Arthur Curry is the bridge between the surface world and his tumultuous realm of the sea.
        <br><br>
        Monarch of the undersea realm of Atlantis and King of the Seven Seas, Aquaman is one of the most powerful DC Super Heroes—commanding a kingdom that covers three-quarters of the Earth’s surface, including all the creatures contained within. Arthur Curry came from humble beginnings, as most of his life was spent exiled from his home, unaware of his noble origins. When he finally took the throne as an adult, he became the most legendary king in Atlantean history.
        <br><br>
        A founding member of the Justice League of America, Aquaman has fought alongside Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman and held his own against the biggest threats the universe has ever seen. Despite being misunderstood by many as someone who merely “talks to fish,” Aquaman’s super-strength and fighting prowess alone make him a force to be reckoned with. His telepathic abilities make him one of the most powerful minds on the planet. If one chooses to underestimate the sea king, they do so at their own peril.`,

        In the name of his murdered parents, Bruce Wayne wages eternal war on the criminals of Gotham City. He is vengeance. He is the night. He is Batman.
        <br><br>
        One of the most iconic fictional characters in the world, Batman has dedicated his life to an endless crusade, a war on all criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he was just a child. Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be a self-made Super Hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame. And he's assembled teams of his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and Batman, Incorporated.
        <br><br>
        A playboy billionaire by day, Bruce Wayne’s double life affords him the comfort of a life without financial worry, a loyal butler-turned-guardian and the perfect base of operations in the ancient network of caves beneath his family’s sprawling estate. By night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape and pointed cowl and takes to the shadowy streets, skies and rooftops of Gotham City.

        biography: `
        Matt Murdock grew up as the son of boxer “Battlin’ Jack” Murdock in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of New York City. Matt’s mother left them when he was quite young, and his father told him that she had died. As Jack aged, he was forced to take work from a local criminal known as the Fixer (Roscoe Sweeny), who eventually coerced the pugilist to work as his enforcer.
        <br><br>
        While Matt was a natural athlete, Jack sought to keep him out of his world of violence, hoping that the boy could get an education and escape Hell’s Kitchen. Jack made Matt promise him that he would study hard and never use his fists. The young Murdock’s commitment to his studies made him a target of bullies, who nicknamed him “Daredevil” when he wouldn’t fight back. Matt worked out his frustrations at the gym.
        <br><br>
        Matt’s life was changed forever when he saw an out-of-control truck speeding toward a blind old man crossing the street. Matt pushed the bystander out of the path of the vehicle, which had been carrying radioactive materials. A container fell off the vehicle and broke open, spilling a radioactive liquid into Matt’s eyes. The incident left the boy blind, but all his remaining senses were enhanced significantly. Soon after, he met Stick, a blind martial-arts master, under whose harsh tutelage Matt came to understand his newly developed senses and blossomed into a formidable fighter.`,

        biography: `
        The child of an abusive father, Bruce Banner grew up shy and introverted, yet a scientific genius. As a young man, thanks to his standout work in the field of nuclear physics, he attracted the attention of the U.S. Army who wanted to adapt his theories for weaponry. Banner resisted such notions, but failed attempts at landing steady work convinced him to accept a position at a federal nuclear research facility at a missile base in the New Mexico desert.
        <br><br>
        At the base, Banner was befriended by Betty Ross, daughter of General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, a man who took an instant disliking to the diminutive, passive scientist. While at the base, Banner began to develop and build a bomb that utilized a high concentration of gamma radiation, a project of high interest to an undercover foreign agent stationed there. When a teenager named Rick Jones wandered onto the test field just as Banner started the countdown for the gamma bomb’s initial test detonation, the scientist rushed out to the area to warn Jones, but the foreign agent purposefully continued the test. The bomb exploded, bathing Bruce Banner in its radiation.
        <br><br>
        Incredibly, he survived the detonation, but later in the evening transformed into a large, grey, man-like monstrosity dubbed a “hulk” by one of the base’s soldiers.`,

        Test pilot Hal Jordan went from being a novelty, the first-ever human Green Lantern, to one of the most legendary Lanterns to ever wield a power ring.
        <br><br>
        Hal Jordan’s life was changed twice by crashing aircraft. The first time was when he witnessed the death of his father, pilot Martin Jordan. The second was when, as an adult and trained pilot himself, he was summoned to the crashed wreckage of a spaceship belonging to an alien named Abin Sur. Abin explained that he was a member of the Green Lantern Corps, an organization of beings from across the cosmos, armed with power rings fueled by the green energy of all willpower in the universe. Upon his death, Abin entrusted his ring and duties as the Green Lantern of Earth’s space sector to Hal Jordan.
        <br><br>
        Hal’s life as a Green Lantern has not been easy. He’s had to fight not only enemies, but often friends, colleagues and loved ones. But despite the strain his Green Lantern identity has put on his life, Hal is an honest man who can operate without fear, and is always willing to protect those in need—whether alone, with the Corps or alongside the Justice League and Earth’s other Super Heroes. For Hal has sworn the oath of every Green Lantern—that no evil will escape his sight.`,

        biography: `
        High school student and child prodigy Peter Parker submerged himself in his passion for science to avoid the taunts and threats of his fellow classmates and stumbled into a world beyond his imagining. While visiting a public exhibition of new breakthroughs in radiation manipulation and genetics, Parker felt the bite of a common house spider exposed to a particle beam and felt immediately ill from it, little realizing how much his life would change in the coming hours.
        <br><br>
        On the way home, the teenager unconsciously avoided a wayward automobile by making an incredible leap to the wall of a nearby building, finding himself miraculously able to stick to it by his hands and feet. Quickly realizing he had somehow acquired the abilities of a spider, he began testing his new-found powers and marveled at their width and breadth. Parker tested his spider abilities in the ring of a local wresting competition and, wearing a mask to hide his identity, easily bested the reigning champion.
        <br><br>
        Parker, an orphan, lived with his kindly Aunt May and Uncle Ben and was wary of exposing them to the public scrutiny that would surely ensue if he revealed his powers to the world, so he adopted a suitable costume and the name of “Spider-Man” to hide his true identity. He also designed and crafted two wrist-worn “web-shooters” to approximate a spider’s web-spinning capability, and with them swiftly became a smash television personality. Now with money to take care of his guardians and acclaim to salve puny Peter Parker’s wounds from classmates, the young man grew cold to everything but his media-darling career.`,

        biography: `
        James Howlett was born to wealthy John and Elizabeth Howlett in Alberta, Canada, during the last years of the 19th century. As a child, he was frail and unhealthy due to his overactive mutant immune system and was neglected by his mother, who had been institutionalized following the death of her first son, John Jr., in 1897. James’s mutant abilities were triggered when his father was shot by the Howlett groundskeeper Thomas Logan, whom he did not know was his real father. James killed Logan, slashed the face of Logan’s son and his friend Dog, and left Alberta with a childhood friend, Rose O’Hara.
        <br><br>
        His healing abilities drove trauma from his memories, leaving him partially amnesiac. He and Rose found refuge at a British Columbia stone quarry, where Rose, claiming James was her cousin, gave his name as “Logan.” Within months, Logan’s powers were heightening due to the environment around him. He became healthier and gained senses to rival those of an animal, but also became more violent. To divert some of this pent-up rage, Logan partook in cage fights where his prowess earned him the nickname “Wolverine.” After accidentally killing Rose with his claws, Logan retreated into the woods where he lived as a feral beast, losing all of his former memories.
        <br><br>
        He would later reenter society and travel the world, partaking in every major conflict of the 20th century (WWI, WWII, the Spanish Civil War, the Vietnam War) as a soldier, criminal, or mercenary for hire. This caused him to coin the phrase "I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice.”`,

        Genius Reed Richards impressed his parents with inventions that made them wealthy, but lost his mother at a very young age. At fourteen, he began to collect doctorates at multiple colleges and dreamed of designing and building a starship, a project pilot Ben Grimm promised to help him fulfill. Richards earned the eternal wrath of fellow student Victor von Doom and the love of his landlady’s niece Sue Storm while at State University and after graduation worked for the U.S. military overseas, which put him in the perfect position to see his dream come true.
        <br><br>
        When the government cut Richards’ funding to the starship, the restless genius gathered Grimm, Sue Storm, and her brother Johnny for an illicit test flight of the craft. Unfortunately, he failed to figure for proper shielding to repel cosmic rays while in space and the four found themselves bombarded by the unique radiation. The ship crash-landed back on Earth, and Richards and the others discovered they’d been mutated by the rays, each of them gaining special abilities. Realizing they could use their powers for the benefit of mankind, Richards founded the Fantastic Four.`,

        Teenager Kara Zor-el was rocketed to Earth from the dying planet Krypton.

        As the most powerful teenager on the planet, the Girl of Steel possesses all of Superman’s powers—from superhuman strength, speed and invulnerability all the way down to his flight and enhanced senses. Still learning to control her awesome powers and lacking her cousin’s self-restraint, she may even be more dangerous than the Man of Steel. Yet, though she may occasionally make youthful mistakes, she's also saved the world many times over, winning the unwavering trust of her adopted home and more than earning her place among Earth's heroes.

        One of the most beloved and iconic DC Super Heroes of all time, Wonder Woman has stood for nearly eighty years as a symbol of truth, justice and equality to people everywhere. Raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, also known as Paradise Island, Diana is an Amazon, like the figures of Greek legend, and her people's gift to humanity.

She stands as an equal among the most powerful Super Heroes, with a sense of purpose to protect the world from injustice in all forms.

        Natasha Romanoff was born in the Soviet Union as Natalia Alianovna Romanova (Наталия Альяновна Романова). Although her exact parentage is unknown, it is rumored that she is related to the late Romanov dynasty—the former rulers of Russia—but those claims have so far been unproven. Orphaned as a child, she was rescued during an attack on Stalingrad by a man named Ivan Petrovitch Bezukhov, who looked after and trained the girl.
        <br><br>
        As she grew older, Natasha’s talents caught the attention of Soviet Intelligence, soon to be known as the KGB, and was recruited into their ranks. During World War II, Natasha was kidnapped by the Hand, who sought to make her a brainwashed master assassin. Luckily, she was rescued by Steve Rogers (Captain America) and Logan (who would later become Wolverine). During the War, the young Natasha served in the Russian army where she fell in love with another young soldier named Nikolai. Despite their initial happiness, their union did not end blissfully. Nikolai was killed in the war and the baby girl they conceived did not survive birth.
        <br><br>
        Following World War II, Natasha progressed into the Black Widow Program, where young girls like her were conditioned to become sleeper agents. Trained at a facility called the Red Room, Natasha was also enhanced with the Soviets’ version of the Super-Soldier serum, gifting her with peak human strength and stamina, as well as resistance to disease and slowed-down aging. Natasha has memories of studying to be a ballerina as a cover during this time. However, because her psyche was tampered with by the government, it is unclear if she actually was ever a ballerina, or these memories were implanted.

That woman is Gamora, an incredibly adept student in the art of combat, war, and death, who has done both evil and good during her galaxy-wide travels. Among her victories: keeping reality safe alongside Adam Warlock, Infinity Watch, and the Guardians of the Galaxy, her current team-turned-family.

        The being who would become the deadliest woman in the galaxy began life as a member of the Zen-Whoberis people. She lived a normal life for the most part until the Badoon arrived and killed every other member of her race.

        Not long after, Thanos found the young girl and took her under his wing. Though he offered her a continued life, it came filled with torturous training and mind games played by the Mad Titan, pitting her against fellow orphan Nebula on a regular basis. During her time with Thanos, Gamora became the incredibly powerful, capable and nearly unkillable woman she's known as around the cosmos, but she still harbors an intense hatred of the man her took a little girl and turned her into that woman.
